Overview of first part of tack (Dylan)

Alright so now I am going to go over the first portion of our tech stack and show how we put this app together.
We picked React to make our app because it gives us an easy way to manage the app's state and it keeps everything organized.
We broke down the app into many different parts and each component manages a single piece of the functionality. 
The primary file is called App.js, and this is where we have the bulk of the app's logic.
Here is where we use React's useState hook to hold our tasks. 
Any time we add a new task, toggle a task, or change what tasks are shown, App.js will update the state of the app, and then the user interface will re-render. 
We had another component called TaskForm, which let users enter a task and submit it to the task list. 
This helps to break the app up into smaller modules, and makes it easier to manage and fix bugs.
Next is TaskList, which has the responsibility of displaying the entire list of tasks. 
TaskList utilizes the TaskItem component to render each task. 
TaskItem has a checkbox inside of it, which allows the user to switch the task from 'to-do' to 'done,' or vice versa.
We also included a TaskFilter component, which uses a dropdown to allow the user to decide what tasks they want to see. 
The filter is also managed by App.js.
In general, we used nothing but React, and its most basic features such as components and state, to create the front-end of the app.
